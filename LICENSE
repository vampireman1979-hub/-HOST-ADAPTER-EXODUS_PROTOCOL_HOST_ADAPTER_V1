ADDITIONAL LICENSE TERMS FOR EXODUSPROTOCOLHOSTADAPTERV1

This adapter is designed to integrate sealed-body organs without modifying them.
While the MIT License permits broad reuse, the following restrictions apply:

1. The adapter must not be used to mutate, subclass, introspect, or otherwise
   alter the sealed ExodusKernel or any other sealed-body organ.

2. The adapter may be improved, extended, or optimized, provided that such
   improvements do not violate sealed-body invariants of the organs it connects.

3. Any derivative work that alters the meaning, symbolic grammar, or structural
   identity of this adapter may not use the name EXODUSPROTOCOLHOSTADAPTERV1.

4. The adapter must preserve the sovereignty of the organ and must not inject
   host identity, state, or behavior into the sealed organ.

5. Violation of these conditions revokes permission to use this adapter.

These terms apply only to this adapter and do not modify MIT permissions for
other components of the repository.
